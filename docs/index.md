<h2>Known issues</h2>

| AMD FidelityFX SDK Sample | API / Configuration | Problem Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FidelityFX CAS / FidelityFX SSSR | DX12 / Release configuration | When unchecking vsync option and losing window focus, some flickering can be observed on some GPUs. |
| FidelityFX CACAO | VK / Release configuration | "Unable to create swapchain" message can occur on select GPU manufacturers. |
| FidelityFX FSR API | VK / Release configuration | UI flickering/disappearing may occur on some Intel Arc GPUs. Occasional hangs may also occur (change and regain Window focus to continue) |
| FidelityFX LPM | Vulkan / All configurations | When rapidly pressing alt-enter to go to full screen mode and back, the HDR display handle can occasionally become lost leading to a dim screen until another full screen toggle is applied again. |
| FidelityFX Hybrid Shadows / FidelityFX FSR | Vulkan / All configurations | Due to resource view handling in the native Vulkan backend, the ability to change the number of cascades on a directional light in Vulkan samples has been disabled to prevent sample instability. |
| FidelityFX DOF | All APIs / All Configs | Some artifacts may occur on some Intel Arc GPUs. |
| All FidelityFX SDK Samples | All APIs / All Configs | There is a resource leak in the UploadContext used to load glTF content. |
| All FidelityFX SDK Samples | All APIs / All Configs | Windows path length restrictions may cause compile issues. It is recommended to place the SDK close to the root of a drive or use subst or a mklink to shorten the path. |
