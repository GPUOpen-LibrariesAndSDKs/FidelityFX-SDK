<!-- @page page_whats-new_index AMD FidelityFX SDK: What's new in FidelityFX SDK 1.0 -->

<h1>What's new in this release of the FidelityFX SDK?</h1>

Welcome to the FidelityFX SDK. This special branch of the FidelityFX SDK contains the initial open source release of FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.0, our next generation upscaling technology. It combines generation of interpolated frames with our temporal multi-frame upscaler, to produce high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs.

This branch is only for the initial open source release of FSR3, and so our other FidelityFX technologies are less well tested. Please use the 1.0 release on `main` if you'd like to do a production integration of our other technologies until the next full release of the SDK when we'll bring everything together.
